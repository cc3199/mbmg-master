description: "After 20 years in the oil industry, Lloyd Furer joined Indiana University and, among other research activities, taught surface geology for 10 years at the Indiana field station near Cardwell, Montana. Since retiring, Lloyd has spent decades correlating subsurface formations in the western U.S. based on his knowledge of surface geology and thousands of geophysical logs from Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and the Dakotas. This collection of over 50 cross sections represents a portion of Lloyd Furerâ€™s correlation work in Montana."
